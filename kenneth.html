    <!-- Kenneth Kaunda -->
   
      <div class="details">
        <p><strong>Early life</strong> Kenneth Kaunda was born on 28 April 1924 at<i> Lubwa Mission </i> in Chinsali , Zambia, and was the youngest of eight children. His father, the<b> Reverend David Kaunda</b>, was an ordained Church of Scotland missionary 
          and teacher, who had been born in  Malawi and had moved to Chinsali, to work at Lubwa Mission. His mother was also a teacher and was the first African woman to teach in colonial Northern Rhodesia. They were both teachers among the Bemba ethnic group which is located in
           northern Zambia. His father died when Kenneth was a child. This is where Kenneth Kaunda received his education until the early 1940s. He later on followed in his parents' footsteps and became a teacher; first in Northern Rhodesia but then in the middle of the 1940s he
            moved to Tanganyika Territory (now part of Tanzania). He also worked in Southern Rhodesia. He attended Munali Training Centre in Lusaka between 1941 and 1943. Early in his career, he read the writings of Mahatma Gandhi that he said: "went straight to my heart."</p>
        <p><strong>THE STRUGGLES AND THE PRESIDENCY</strong> In 1949 Kaunda entered politics and became the founding member of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambian_African_National_Congress" target="_blank"> Northern Rhodesian African National Congress</a>. On <b> November 1953</b> he moved
           to Lusaka to take up the post of Secretary General of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" target="_blank">African National Congress (ANC),</a>
         under the presidency of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nkumbula" target="_blank">Harry Nkumbula</a>. The combined efforts of Kaunda and Nkumbula failed to mobilise native African peoples against the European-dominated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1955 Kaunda and Nkumbula were imprisoned for two months with hard labour for distributing
          subversive literature. The two leaders drifted apart as Nkumbula became increasingly influenced by white liberals and failing to defend indigenous Africans, Kaunda led a dissident group to Nkumbula that eventually broke with the ANC and founded his own party, the<b> Zambian African 
          National Congress (ZANC) in October 1958</b>. ZANC was banned in March 1959 and Kaunda was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, which he spent first in Lusaka, then in Salisbury.
        
          <p2> While Kaunda was in prison,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainza_Chona" target="_blank"> Mainza chona</a> and other nationalists broke away from the ANC and, in <b> October 1959,</b> Chona became the first president of the <b>United National Independence Party (UNIP)</b>, the successor to ZANC. However, Chona did not see himself as the party's main founder. 
          When Kaunda was released from prison in January 1960 he was elected president of UNIP. In 1960 he visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr." target="_blank">Martin Luther King Jr</a>. in Atlanta and afterwards, in July 1961, Kaunda organised a <b>civil disobedience campaign</b> in Northern Province, the so-called <b>Cha-cha-cha campaign</b>, which consisted largely of arson and obstructing significant roads.
           Kaunda subsequently ran as a UNIP candidate during the 1962 elections. This resulted in a UNIP–ANC Coalition government, with Kaunda as Minister of Local Government and Social Welfare. In January 1964, UNIP won the next major elections, defeating their ANC rivals and securing Kaunda's position as prime minister. On <b> October 1964</b>
           he became the first president of an independent Zambia, appointing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Kamanga" target="_blank">Reuben Kamanga</a> as his vice-president.</p2>
           
        <p><strong>FALL FROM PRESIDENCY</strong> After 26 years of KK being the president, matters quickly came to a head in 1990. In July, amid three days of rioting in the capital, Kaunda announced a referendum on whether to legalise other parties would be held that October. However, he argued for maintaining UNIP's monopoly, claiming that a multiparty system would lead to chaos. 
          The announcement almost came too late; hours later, a disgruntled officer went on the radio to announce Kaunda had been overthrown. The coup attempt was broken three to four hours later, but it was clear Kaunda and the UNIP were reeling. Kaunda tried to mollify the opposition by moving the referendum to <b>August 1991;</b> the opposition claimed the original date did not allow enough time for voter registration.
          While expressing willingness to have the Zambian people vote on a <b>multiparty system,</b> Kaunda maintained that only a one-party state could prevent tribalism and violence from engulfing the country. By September, however, opposition demands forced Kaunda to reverse course. He cancelled the referendum, and instead recommended constitutional amendments that would
           dismantle UNIP's monopoly on power. He also announced a snap general election for the following year, two years before it was due. He signed the necessary amendments into law in December.          
          At these elections, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), helmed by trade union leader <b>Frederick Chiluba,</b> swept UNIP from power in a landslide. In the presidential election, Kaunda was roundly defeated, taking only <b>24%</b> of the vote to Chiluba's <b>75%</b> . UNIP was cut down to only 25 seats in the National Assembly. One of the issues in the campaign was a
           plan by Kaunda to turn over one-quarter of the nation's land to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi" target="_blank">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>, an Indian guru who promised that he would use it for a network of utopian agricultural enclaves that proponents said would create "Heaven on Earth".Kaunda was forced in a television interview to deny practising Transcendental Meditation. When Kaunda
            handed power to Chiluba on 2 November 1991, he became the second mainland African head of state to allow free multiparty elections and to relinquish power peacefully after he had lost. The first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_K%C3%A9r%C3%A9kou" target="_blank">Mathieu Kérékou</a> of Benin, had done so in March of that year. </p>
