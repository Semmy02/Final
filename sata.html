    <!-- Michael Sata -->
   
      <div class="details">
        <p><strong>Early life</strong> Michael Charles Chilufya Sata was born on <b>6 July 1937</b>,and brought up in Mpika, Northern Province. He worked under
           the Zambian Police Service as a police officer, then later as railway man and trade unionist during colonial rule. He spent some time in London working
            on the railway as a cleaner. Among other things, he was a porter at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Victoria_station" target="_blank">Victoria railway station</a>. Sata began actively participating in the politics of
             Northern Rhodesia in 1963. Following independence, Sata worked his way up through the rough-and-tumble rank-and-file of the ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_National_Independence_Party" target="_blank">United National 
             Independence Party (UNIP) </a> to the governorship of Lusaka in 1985. As Governor, he made his mark as a man of action with a hands on approach. He cleaned
              up the streets, patched roadways and built bridges in the city. Afterward he became a member of parliament for Kabwata constituency in Lusaka.
               Though once close with President Kenneth Kaunda, he became disillusioned by Kaunda's dictatorial style and he left the UNIP to join the
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Multi-Party_Democracy" target="_blank">Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD)</a>  during the campaign for multi-party politics in 1991</p>
     
               <p><strong>Formation of the patriotic front</strong> In 2001, President Chiluba nominated Levy Mwanawasa as the MMD's presidential candidate for
           the 2001 election. In frustration, Sata left the MMD and set up a new party, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Front_(Zambia)" target="_blank"> Patriotic Front (PF)</a>. He contested the 2001 election but did not do wellâ€”his party
            only won one seat in parliament. Sata conceded defeat and continued to campaign</p>

            <p><strong>Presidency</strong> Sata ran for President for a fourth time in the election held on <b> 20 September 2011</b>. In the early stages of the campaign he was more vitriolic in his anti-Chinese
               rhetoric, but he later toned down his rhetoric. Results showed him receiving about 43% of the vote against 36% for Banda, and Chief Justice Ernest Sakala accordingly declared that he had won
                the election in the early hours of <b> 23 September</b>. He was sworn in later in the day. He was said to have won because of the urban vote. Despite the toning down of his rhetoric, the investment
                 climate in Zambia was considered uncertain in the wake of his victory.</p>
