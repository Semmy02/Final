    <!-- Levy Mwanawasa -->
   
      <div class="details">
        <p><strong>Early life</strong> Levy Mwanawasa was born in Mufulira, Northern Rhodesia, as the second of 10 children. He held a law degree from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zambia" target="_blank"> University of 
          Zambia</a>  He worked in private law firms from 1974 until 1978 when he formed his own firm: Mwanawasa & Company. In 1985, Mwanawasa served as Solicitor General 
          in the Zambian government but he went back to private practice in 1986.
          Levy Patrick Mwanawasa
          In 1989, he led the legal defence team for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christon_Tembo" target="_blank">Lt. Gen Christon Tembo</a>,
           who was accused by the <a href="kenneth kaunda.html">kenneth kaunda</a> government of conspiracy to overthrow the government,
           which was judged as an act of treason worthy of the death penalty; Tembo won the case against the state, and Mwanawasa's fame among the anti-Kaunda opposition grew.
            After <a href="chiluba.html">Frederick chiluba</a> was elected as president, he appointed Mwanawasa as vice-president in November 1991. Mwanawasa left his firm in <b>march 1992</b>.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Politics</strong> Mwanawasa served as vice-president until he resigned in July 1994. In 1996 he unsuccessfully challenged Chiluba for the presidency
           of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Multi-Party_Democracy" target="_blank"> Movement for  Multiparty Democracy</a>. After the loss, Mwanawasa retired from politics until the 2001 election.</p>
           
           <p><strong>policies</strong> Foreign investors liked Mwanawasa, owing partly to his anti-corruption drive. During his presidency, Zambia received foreign investment. The main driver of economic growth was minerals. Mwanawasa's 
            policies helped to lower inflation and spread some benefits to the poor. Tourists and white farmers diverted from Zimbabwe and helped Zambian economy. Mwanawasa turned the Zambian town of <b>Livingstone</b>, near <b> Victoria Falls</b>,
             into a tourist hub.[14] Zambia received a relatively large amount of aid and debt relief because of liberalisation and Mwanawasa's "stolid efforts". Overall, economic growth increased to about 6% per year.

            Mwanawasa criticised President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe" target="_blank"> Robert Mugabe</a> of neighbouring Zimbabwe. Mwanawasa was one of the first African leaders to publicly do so. When Mwanawasa died, Zimbabwean opposition leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Tsvangirai" target="_blank"> Morgan Tsvangirai</a> was among the first to publicly express grief.            
            Mwanawasa sold off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konkola_Copper_Mines" target="_blank">Konkola Copper Mines</a>  to Vedanta for $25m despite an initial asking price of $400m. An amount (i.e. $25m) the company made back in around 3 months and was later making a minimum of $500m in profit per year despite its environmental pollutions of the local community..</p>
